/*
Package errors provides sophisticated, but simple error handling for Go. Refer to the README.md, examples and unit tests
for usage and details.

The original idea and code was based on https://github.com/upspin/upspin/blob/master/errors/errors.go, but has undergone
substantial re-factoring to simplify usage and provide additional flexibility.
